Implement pow(x, n).

Notice

You don't need to care about the precision of your answer, it's acceptable if the expected answer and your answer 's difference is smaller than 1e-3.

Example
Pow(2.1, 3) = 9.261
Pow(0, 1) = 0
Pow(1, 0) = 1

实现 pow(x,n)

 注意事项

不用担心精度，当答案和标准输出差绝对值小于1e-3时都算正确
