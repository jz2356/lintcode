here are n coins in a line. Two players take turns to take one or two coins from right side until there are no more coins left. The player who take the last coin wins.

Could you please decide the first play will win or lose?
Example
n = 1, return true.

n = 2, return true.

n = 3, return false.

n = 4, return true.

n = 5, return true.


有 n 个硬币排成一条线。两个参赛者轮流从右边依次拿走 1 或 2 个硬币，直到没有硬币为止。拿到最后一枚硬币的人获胜。

请判定 第一个玩家 是输还是赢？
