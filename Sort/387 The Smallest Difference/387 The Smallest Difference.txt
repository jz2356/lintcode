Given two array of integers(the first array is array A, the second array is array B), now we are going to find a element in array A which is A[i], and another element in array B which is B[j], so that the difference between A[i] and B[j] (|A[i] - B[j]|) is as small as possible, return their smallest difference.

Example
For example, given array A = [3,6,7,4], B = [2,8,9,3], return 0

给定两个整数数组（第一个是数组 A，第二个是数组 B），在数组 A 中取 A[i]，数组 B 中取 B[j]，A[i] 和 B[j]两者的差越小越好(|A[i] - B[j]|)。返回最小差。
